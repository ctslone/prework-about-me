      <p>I have always loved computers and technology and want to pursue a career in something I enjoy. My current job has a lot of unpredictibility associated with it and so I would like to have a job where I know where I will be and what I will be doing most days. I have always enjoyed creating things and solving problems, so becoming a software developer would allow me to do both!</p>
